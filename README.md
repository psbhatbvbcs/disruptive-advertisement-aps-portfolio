## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Disruptive advertisements, driven by sophisticated algorithms and big data analytics, reshape marketing by delivering personalized ad experiences. Tailored to individual preferences, they enhance user engagement and brand satisfaction. Companies benefit from optimized targeting, yielding higher conversion rates and ROI. These ads offer valuable insights into consumer behavior, refining marketing strategies and boosting competitiveness. Ultimately, disruptive advertisements signify a paradigm shift, aligning user satisfaction with business success, and standing as a cornerstone of modern digital marketing strategies.

## Why Portfolio <a name="why-portfolio"></a>

Creating a portfolio project for my Algorithmic Problem Solving course, focusing on implementing or simulating an ad suggestion mechanism, offers several advantages:

1. **Application of DSA Concepts**
2. **Problem-Solving Practice**
3. **Algorithm Optimization**
4. **Data Handling Skills**
5. **Interdisciplinary Application**
6. **Step to becoming a better engineer and a problem solver**
7. **Portfolio Enhancement**

## Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>

By the end of this portfolio project, I aim to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Learn New Algorithms**: Explore and implement new algorithms relevant to ad suggestion and targeting to enhance my algorithmic problem-solving skills.

2. **Learn about the process of the Ad Suggestion Process**: Understand the ad suggestion process to understand the underlying algorithms and mechanisms involved.

3. **Build of corpus of algorithms and data structures that can be used for the same**: Build a repositories of codes for numerous algorithms and structures which can be used in building an application for the same.

4. **Implement Advertiser Bidding System**: Create an application where advertisers can bid for advertisement placements, simulating a real-world bidding system.


These objectives will enable me to apply my knowledge of Algorithmic Problem Solving to develop a comprehensive ad suggestion mechanism, while also gaining practical experience in building efficient database systems and optimizing system performance.
