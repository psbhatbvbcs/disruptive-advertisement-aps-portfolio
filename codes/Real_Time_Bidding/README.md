Implements first price and second price using skip lists. Additional conditions can be set which takes care of hard price flow and soft price flow or other 
conditions to increase the skip list level. Finding max in each level is very quick as it is always sorted.

Other methods include Priority Queues, BST's. Skip lists offer a slightly less overhead.
