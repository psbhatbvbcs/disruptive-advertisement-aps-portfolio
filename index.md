## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Disruptive advertisements, driven by sophisticated algorithms and big data analytics, reshape marketing by delivering personalized ad experiences. Tailored to individual preferences, they enhance user engagement and brand satisfaction. Companies benefit from optimized targeting, yielding higher conversion rates and ROI. These ads offer valuable insights into consumer behavior, refining marketing strategies and boosting competitiveness. Ultimately, disruptive advertisements signify a paradigm shift, aligning user satisfaction with business success, and standing as a cornerstone of modern digital marketing strategies.

## Objectives <a name="objectives"></a>

By the end of this portfolio project, I aim to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Learn New Algorithms**: Explore and implement new algorithms relevant to ad suggestion and targeting to enhance my algorithmic problem-solving skills.

2. **Learn about the process of the Ad Suggestion Process**: Understand the ad suggestion process to understand the underlying algorithms and mechanisms involved.

3. **Build of corpus of algorithms and data structures that can be used for the same**: Build a repositories of codes for numerous algorithms and structures which can be used in building an application for the same.

4. **Implement Advertiser Bidding System**: Create an application where advertisers can bid for advertisement placements, simulating a real-world bidding system.


These objectives will enable me to apply my knowledge of Algorithmic Problem Solving to develop a comprehensive ad suggestion mechanism, while also gaining practical experience in building efficient database systems and optimizing system performance.

## Design <a name="design"></a>

### High-Level Design of Targeted Advertising <a name="high-level-design"></a>

Here's a high-level overview of the targeted advertising process, incorporating key players and technologies:

1. **Publishers:** Websites or apps that display advertisements (e.g., news sites, social media platforms).

2. **Advertisers:** Businesses that create and pay for advertisements to reach their target audience.

3. **Supply-Side Platform (SSP):**  A platform that helps publishers manage and sell their ad inventory. 

4. **Demand-Side Platform (DSP):** A platform that helps advertisers manage and buy ad inventory.

5. **Ad Exchange:**  A marketplace where publishers and advertisers connect through SSPs and DSPs to buy and sell ad impressions in real-time.

6. **Real-Time Bidding (RTB):**  An automated auction system where advertisers bid on the opportunity to show their ads to users in real-time.

**Process:**

* **Advertisers** create campaigns, targeting specific demographics, interests, and behaviors.
* **Publishers** integrate with **SSPs** to manage their ad inventory and make it available for bidding.
* **DSPs** connect with **Ad Exchanges** and receive user data and ad inventory information.
* **When a user visits a publisher's website, an RTB auction is triggered.**
* **DSPs bid on the impression based on user profile data and campaign targeting criteria.**
* **The highest bidder wins the impression and their ad is served to the user.**

**Algorithms and Data Structures:**

* **User Profiling:** Clustering, collaborative filtering, content-based filtering
* **Campaign Management:** Search algorithms, sorting algorithms, data validation
* **Bidding and Auction:** Auction algorithms (first-price, second-price), machine learning for bid optimization
* **Ad Serving and Tracking:** Hash tables, queueing algorithms, data logging
* **Performance Analysis and Optimization:** Machine learning, A/B testing

## Challenges <a name="challenges"></a>

This project will present some interesting challenges:

* **Data Scalability:** Handling large volumes of user data and ad inventory efficiently.
* **Real-time Processing:** Processing bids and serving ads in real-time while maintaining low latency.
* **Privacy and Security:** Ensuring user data privacy and protection from fraudulent activity.
* **Algorithm Optimization:** Finding the most efficient algorithms for user profiling, ad targeting, and bidding.
* **User Experience:**  Balancing personalized advertising with user privacy and a positive experience.

## To-Do <a name="to-do"></a>

Here's a list of tasks I plan to tackle for this portfolio project:

* **Research and Choose Algorithms:**  Explore different algorithms from the course syllabus (and beyond) to implement key functionalities.
* **Research Data Structures:**  Research appropriate data structures to efficiently store user profiles, campaigns, ads, bids, and performance data.
* **Evaluate and Analyze Results:**  Measure the performance of the system using various metrics, identify areas for improvement, and reflect on the algorithms and design choices.
